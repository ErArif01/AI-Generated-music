# AI-Generated music compositions
AI-generated music compositions involve the use of artificial intelligenec algorithms to create original pieces of music. These algorithms can analyze existing musical data, learn patterns, and generate new compositions based on that learning.
Here are some key aspects and examples of AI-generated music : 

# 1. Generative models - 
AI-generated music often relies on generative models, such as recurrent neural network or generative adversarial network. These models are trained on large datasets of existing music to learn patterns, styles, and structures.

# 2. MIDI data and symbolic representations - 
AI models can work with MIDI (musical instrument digital interface) data or symbolic representations of music, allowing them to capture various elements like melody, harmony, and rhythm.
