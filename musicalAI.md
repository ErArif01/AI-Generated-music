# Musical AI research
Musical AI research involves the exploration of artificial intelligence techniques and technologies to create, analyze, or enhance music. This interdisciplinary field combines elements of computer science, machine learning, music theory, and 
cognitive science. Here are some keys areas of research in musical AI.

# 1. Generative Models -
Research focuses on developing generative models that can create original music. This includes recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory network and generative adversarial network trained on large datasets of musical compositions. 

# 2. Style transfer and lmitation - 
Researchers aim to create AI systems that can imitate or transfer the style of one composer or genre to another. This involves understanding the distinctive features of different musical styles and translating them into new compositions.
